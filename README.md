# Heroku Buildpack for Installing Sass (Ruby) for gulp-ruby-sass

This buildpack will work out-of-the-box with Ember CLI generated applications. It installs node, Sass (Ruby gem), nginx and generates a production build with the Ember CLI.

*Sass (Ruby) is used to allow `gulp-ruby-sass` to compile the sass*

## Usage

You will need to set multiple buildpacks, to work with this one.
